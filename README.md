This is a simple two player Hangman game where one player selects a word to be guessed by the other player. The next update will include a one player mode against a computer player.


## Running the game:

type the command $ make

then type the command $ ./Hangman

From there the user interface will instruct you in the game.

One player enters a valid word, then the other player guesses a letter of the word until they find all the letters or the hangman is complete.
